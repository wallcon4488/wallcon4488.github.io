In the original The Legend of Zelda dungeon, I coded most of the enemies and their movements, the camera movement, and all of the enemy/room clear drops.
Additionally, I coded the triggers such as automatically locking doors, moveable blocks, and door/key unlocks.
In our custom dungeon, I designed the entirety of the dungeon layout, the ball launchers, and how the ball bounces off of walls after being hit.
