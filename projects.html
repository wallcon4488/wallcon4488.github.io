    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://wallcon.itch.io/eecs-494-project-1">The Legend of Zelda (Unity Remaster)</a></li>
        In the original The Legend of Zelda dungeon, I coded most of the enemies and their movements, the camera movement,
        and all of the enemy/room clear drops. Additionally, I coded the triggers such as automatically locking doors,
        moveable blocks, and door/key unlocks. In our custom dungeon, I designed the entirety of the dungeon layout,
        the ball launchers, and how the ball bounces off of walls after being hit.

        <li><a href="https://wallcon.itch.io/eecs-494-project-2">Titan</a></li>
        Titan is a game I made almost entirely from scratch, minus the sprites and sound effects. I designed player movement,
        player abilities, camera movement, enemy design, level design, respawn mechanics and most importantly, the concept
        and implementation of the player character being able to transform between their regular size and their "titan" form.
        I hope to expand on this game in my free time, because I think it is a really interesting mechanic.

        <li><a href="https://personman32.itch.io/tennis-hero">Tennis Hero</a></li>
        Tennis Hero is a 3D third-person action-adventure game where players travel across an island resort and defeat enemies
        by hitting the enemies' tennis balls back at them. This game was developed from scratch by 5 people over the course of
        6 weeks for the final project of our Senior Capstone, EECS 494: Introduction to Game Development. In the group, I acted
        as the creative lead and a general programmer. I came up with the story, theming, level concepts, projectile types, and
        a large potion of the enemies. I came up with the idea of the Robot Army and coded most of their functionality. More
        importantly, however, I came up with each of the three bosses and coded them by hand. Using free 3D models from the
        Unity Asset Store, I was able to make engaging and fun sport-themed boss fights. Finally, I wrote and the directed the
        trailer for Tennis Hero, which can be seen on the itch.io page.
